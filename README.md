# Drape
A fabric design and simulation tool. Built in [three.js](http://threejs.org/) starting from the [cloth simulation](http://threejs.org/examples/webgl_animation_cloth) example.

## To run on local computer:

1. Download code
2. Opening index.html runs the simulator without textures. To get textures to work, you need to run the code from a local server (instructions [here](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-an-existing-project-to-github-using-the-command-line/)). Alternatively, a simple solution is to run the code using the [p5 editor](http://p5js.org/download/).

## TODO

1. ~~Fork three.js cloth simulation example~~
2. Add ability to apply forces to edges
3. Model shear & bending stiffness (try out different models for bending stiffness)
4. Sliders / controls for above parameters
5. Test wrinkling and folding abilities
6. Add constraints, e.g. object collision & avoiding self intersections of cloth
7. Develop a minimal graphical UI
8. Export to STL?
9. Future directions: consider different possibilities for human computer interaction
