# Drape

1. ~~Fork three.js cloth simulation example~~
2. Add ability to apply forces to edges
3. Model shear & bending stiffness (try out different models for bending stiffness)
4. Sliders / controls for above parameters
5. Test wrinkling and folding abilities
6. Add constraints, e.g. object collision & avoiding self intersections of cloth
7. Develop a minimal graphical UI
8. Export to STL?
9. Future directions: consider different possibilities for human computer interaction
