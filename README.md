# Drape
A fabric design and simulation tool. [Test version](https://cdn.rawgit.com/aatishb/drape/master/index.html). Built in [three.js](http://threejs.org/) starting from the [cloth simulation](http://threejs.org/examples/webgl_animation_cloth) example.

## To run on local computer:

1. Download code
2. Opening index.html runs the simulator without textures. For textures to work, run the code on a local server ([instructions](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-an-existing-project-to-github-using-the-command-line/)). Alternatively, run the code using the [p5 editor](http://p5js.org/download/).

## TODO

1. Modify cloth shape and behavior
2. Add table (for cloth to fall on)
3. Add additional forces to edges (to test folding/wrinkling)
4. Add shear & bending stiffness (try different models for bending stiffness)
5. Test wrinkling and folding abilities
6. Improve collision detection & avoiding self intersections of cloth
7. Develop a minimal, easy-to-use GUI
8. Add export to STL
9. Future directions: consider different possibilities for human computer interaction
